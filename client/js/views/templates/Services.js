        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>The services provided by ASIDACO are broken into three main categories:</p>
        <div class="service-list">
            <h3>Project Development</h3>
            <p>ASIDACO provides a number of services to meet the renewable energy needs of its
            clients. What sets ASIDACO apart from many other renewable energy service companies
            is its “owner’s representative” approach toward its client. ASIDACO protects the client’s
            interests against undue costs, incompetence, and other pitfalls that a client could face
            alone without representation.</p>
            <p>One key service ASIDACO can provide is the acquisition of funding for its client’s
            projects, whether via a private or commercial financial investor, utility rebate, production
            incentive, state grant, or property tax exemption program, among others.</p>
            <p>There are numerous areas where ASIDACO, as a devoted owner’s rep company, realizes
            each client’s needs for energy solutions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wind and Current Turbine or Solar Photovoltaic Site Development</li>
                <li>Wind and Current Turbine or Solar Photovoltaic Operation and Maintenance packages</li>
                <li>Utility Interconnection and Sub Station Development</li>
                <li>Energy Storage and Energy Conservation Retrofit Projects</li>
                <li>Distributed Energy System Development</li>
                <li>Green Roof and Brown Water Retention Project Development</li>
                <li>Atrium and Natural Light Project Development</li>
                <li>Building Envelope Weatherizing of Architectural Structures</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Operation and Maintenance Packages</h3>
            <p>ASIDACO Renewable Energy Maintenance Packages give the client (owner of systems)
            a selection of packages that are tailored to meet their needs. Some of the maintenance
            packages are shown below.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>ASIDACO can act as a third party monitoring company. This program can be an added
                assurance to the client that is under a warranty contract to verify optimal maintenance
                procedures to maximum energy output of the system on a continual basis.</li>
                <li>ASIDACO handles the Operation and Maintenance of the system for the client after
                the warranty period expires.</li>
                <li>The ASIDACO team can also introduce a training program into the clients operations
                in order to allow the internal maintenance of their own systems. After the initial contract
                period has expired the ASIDACO on–site staff will be turned over to the client and
                remain on site to continue maintaining the system.</li>
                <li>ASIDACO can startup and commission energy systems during functional testing and
                complete oversight of the systems operation and maintenance procedures during the
                initial warranty period. <span class="emphasis">Note that most malfunctions occur during initial startup and
                operation within the first year</span>.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Power Conditioning & Utility Interconnection</h3>
            <p>This arena has huge potential because of the problems associated with an antiquated
            electrical grid in this country. Add to the problem the addition of renewable Energy
            production projects and the problem becomes worse. The reason is due to unstable
            electrical production associated with these types of renewable electrical energies.</p>
            <p>ASIDACO will foster the deployment of control systems to our clients, creating a more
            stable utility interconnection and thus reducing applicable penalties for unregulated
            power transmission from the renewable systems.</p>
