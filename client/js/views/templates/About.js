        <h2>About the Founder</h4>
        <p>Andrea Bashaw, the founder of ASIDACO is passionate about alternative ways to produce energy,
        principles in science, design, and construction, and the progression of these in industry. This passion for
        technology, humanity, and social well-being has been a prime motivation for founding ASIDACO, LLC.
        She understands the importance of focusing on problems one step at a time in order to solve them. She
        is highly skilled at managing people, electrical problem assessment, design, development, construction,
        and commissioning of electrical and energy projects.</p>
        <p>During her tenure at ASIDACO, she has directed the engineering efforts for the design and construction
        control of several large solar energy projects and their integration to the electrical grid as well as
        standard electrical construction projects. She has given presentations concerning the need for power
        quality and voltage control as it relates to renewable energy and connection of it to the utility grid or on
        a local facility distribution system while leading day to day operations of the company.</p>
        <p>Andrea entered the ASIDACO team and one of her product designs into the prestigious ‘MASS
        Challenge’, known around the world as a contest for growing companies and new innovative products.
        Although ASIDACO scored high in several areas with very positive comments from the judges the
        company never made it past the first round. Despite this setback, Andrea has continued to progress
        product ideas and project designs forward toward eventual production.</p>
        <p>Prior to launching ASIDACO, Andrea spent five years as an Electrical Design and Commissioning Engineer
        with Sebesta Blomberg, a nationally recognized provider of full-service engineering and design services.
        During her tenure she led or participated in the electrical design development of multiple large -scale
        construction, energy projects, and electrical equipment facility assessments while providing in-depth
        electrical project commissioning expertise for several projects across New England. Her project history
        while at this company included utility infrastructures and substations, medium voltages high rise
        buildings, hospitals and ‘Solar PV’ and ‘Wind Turbine’ studies or Audits. She gained a reputation for her
        integrity and exceeded expected results.</p>
        <p>Her first accomplishment in her professional career was development of a facility that incorporated
        sustainable design initiatives. This project included development of a small distributed power plant
        while at the same time utilizing and rebuilding voltage stabilization components for that system at the
        facility. She managed the facility’s operation and maintenance for 16 years post-construction.</p>
        <p>Andrea started her electrical career straight out of high school by enrolling in night school toward an
        electrical engineering technology degree while working full time during the day in the construction
        industry and eventually electrical construction.</p>
        <p>Andrea deployed her services and electrical capabilities while serving in the electrical industry as an
        IBEW member with the classification of an ‘Inside Wireman’ journeyperson, and still carries that
        membership today.</p>
